### Analysis of US Housing Market Data - [View Here](https://github.com/graceli5/PIC-16B-Final-Project.git)

_Completed in collaboration with UCLA peers during the 2023-2024 school year as a capstone for Advanced Python with Applications course_

**Project**: Analyzing what factors most heavily influence US housing prices, and constructing a model to classify listing prices.
- Merged together four datasets, preformed data cleaning, and explored dimension reduciton/feature selection to prepare information for modeling.
- Created in-depth Seaborn visualizations to depict trends between real estate prices, physical house features, and societal factors

### Machine Learning Research on Music Data - [View Here](https://github.com/graceli5/UPF-work.git)

_Research work done as a UPF Music Technology Group Intern._

**Project**: Researching whether it is possible to predict when a participant is singing using correct or poor posture using only respiration sensor data.
- Created statistical summary features of respiration patterns for each note sung including data like mean, median, variance, peak spacing, range, etc.
- Constructed Scikit-Learn models (knn, random forest, logistic regression, svm) taking in these summary features and utilizing parameter tuning and cross validation to inform decision. Explored TensorFlow neural network models to produce similar predictions and compared testing accuracies.

**Project**: Exploring the accuracy with which models can predict the pitch/note a singer is at by analyzing their facial position in video data.
