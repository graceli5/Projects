Completed in collaboration with UCLA peers during the 2023-2024 school year as a capstone for Advanced Python with Applications course.

**Project 1**: Analyzing what factors most heavily influence US housing prices, and constructing a model to classify housing prices.
- Merged together four datasets and preformed data cleaning to prepare information for use.
- Created in-depth Seaborn visualizations to depict trends between real estate prices, physical house features, and societal factors

Research work done as a UPF Music Technology Group Intern.

**Project 2**: Researching whether it is possible to predict when a participant is singing using correct or poor posture using only respiration sensor data.
- Created statistical summary features of respiration patterns for each note sung including data like mean, median, variance, peak spacing, range, etc.
- Constructed Scikit-Learn models (knn, random forest, logistic regression, svm) taking in these summary features and utilizing parameter tuning and cross validation to inform decision. Explored TensorFlow neural network models to produce similar predictions and compared testing accuracies.

**Project 3**: Exploring the accuracy with which models can predict the pitch or note a singer is at by analyzing their facial position in video data.
