### Analysis of US Housing Market Data - [View Here](https://github.com/graceli5/PIC-16B-Final-Project.git)

_Completed in collaboration with UCLA peers during the 2023-2024 school year._

**Project**: Analyzing what factors most heavily influence US housing prices and constructing a model to classify listing prices.
- Merged and cleaned four datasets, applying dimensionality reduction, label encoding, and feature selection techniques.
- Developed Seaborn visualizations to highlight feature trends and correlations.
- Built and compared SVM, logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, random forest, and ensemble models, using Grid-Search for parameter tuning and cross-validation.
- Optimized a neural network model by tuning depth, batch size, and activation functions, and used a confusion matrix to analyze errors.

### Machine Learning Research on Music Data - [View Here](https://github.com/graceli5/UPF-work.git)

_Research work done as a UPF Music Technology Group Intern._

**Project**: Exploring the accuracy with which models can predict the pitch/note one is singing at by analyzing their facial position in video data.
- Developed high-performing KNN and random forest models to classify notes into four categories using 60 facial landmarks.
- Applied PCA dimensionality reduction, retaining model effectiveness in 4 components.
- Conducted feature importance analysis to identify facial points most indicative of pitch.

**Project**: Researching whether it is possible to predict when a participant is singing using correct or poor posture using only respiration sensor data.
- Generated statistical summary features from respiration data for each sung note.
- Built and fine-tuned Scikit-Learn (KNN, random forest, logistic regression, SVM) and TensorFlow FNN models, using cross-validation to enhance prediction accuracy.

### Identifying Fake News with Neural Networks - [View Here](https://github.com/graceli5/Fake-News-Classification.git)

**Project**: Training neural networks on vectorized text data to classify fake vs real news
- Executed natural language processing (NLP) techniques to clean, tokenize, and vectorize news articles, constructing a new TensorFlow dataset.
- Developed and trained multiple neural network models: one title-based, one text-based, and one combined input using a functional API.
- Plotted training vs. validation metrics to evaluate performance and conducted accuracy comparisons to determine the most effective model architecture.
  
### Visualization of Climate Data - [View Here](https://github.com/graceli5/Data-Visualization-Climate.git)

**Project**: Practicing querying, joining, and visualizing databases to depict the historical effects of Global Warming.
- Consolidated, merged, and cleaned multiple datasets to extract key features.
- Applied querying techniques, dataframe stacking, and advanced Matplotlib tools to generate insightful subplots, scatter plots, and bar plots, clearly illustrating trends in data.
