Research work done as a UPF Music Technology Group Intern.

Respiration and Posture Project:
- Researched whether it is possible to predict whether a participant is singing using correct or poor posture using only respiration sensor data.
- Created statistical summary features for respiration vectors of each note sung including data like mean, median, variance, peaks, range, etc.
- Constructed models (knn, random forest, logistic regression, svm) taking in these summary features and utilizing parameter tuning and cross validation. These models scored at around 75% testing accuracy when classifying into two evenly split posture categories and around 70% when classifying into three evenly split posture types.
- Explored neural network models to produce similar predictions, however accuracy decreased with deep-learning.
